Comparison of argument-parsing libraries for writing command-line programs: argparse, click, docopt


ArgParse
commander-ap.py

Click
commander-cl.py

DocOpt
commander-do.py

Each example works similarly or identically and has two commands 'green' and 'blue'.
The target of any command is the main argument, which is the last argument.
Options may also be passed.

TODO: Add options support and mention it here.
